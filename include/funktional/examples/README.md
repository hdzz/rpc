The example code in this directory has been spliced out into it's own project entitled `rpc`, [(real) C++ Parser
Combinators](https://github.com/daltonwoodard/rpc).

The code here has fallen far behind the development of `rpc`, and so for reference I would encourage visiting that
repository instead.
